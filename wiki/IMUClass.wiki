IMU Class Documentation

To integrate the nav6 IMU into your robot control software, source code for a C++ named IMU, which is based upon the WPI Library, is provided.

To instantiate the IMU, the IMU constructor must be provided a pointer to an instance of the WPI Library *!SerialPort* class.

{{{
    // Instantiate Serial Port object

    // Serial settings are:
    // - Baud Rate:  57600
    // - Data Bits:  8
    // - Stop Bits:  1
    // - Parity:     None

    SerialPort *imu_serial_port = new SerialPort(57600);

    // Instantiate IMU object

    IMU *imu = new IMU(imu_serial_port);
}}}

The IMU::IsConnected() method indicates whether data is successfully being received from the IMU.  At this point, the IMU::GetPitch(), IMU::GetRoll() and IMU::GetYaw() methods can be used to access the latest values received from the IMU.

The IMU::GetUpdateCount() can be used to determine if new yaw/pitch/roll values have arrived.
