In addition to the Basic nav6 [Protocol], the nav6 firmware implements several messages which may be useful to more advanced users. 

= Advanced Messages =

== Raw Sensor Data Update Message ==

The Raw Sensor Data update message communications notifications of raw sensors readings; this update message may be useful when the Yaw/Pitch/Roll/Compass Heading provides insufficient information:

  * With the quaternions and the raw acceleration data, the world linear acceleration (the true acceleration, with the gravity component removed) can be calculated.

  * Additionally, with the raw magnetometer data, it is possible to implement soft iron calibration.  Note that the raw magnetometer data has already had hard iron calibration applied.

||Byte Offset||Element||Data Type||

||20||Acceleration Y (16-bits, signed)||16-bit Integer||
||24||Acceleration Z (16-bits, signed)||16-bit Integer||
||28||Magnetometer X (12 bits, signed)||16-bit Integer||

== Stream Configuration Command ==

By default, the nav6 IMU begins transmitting YPR Updates upon power up.  The Stream Configuration Command is sent to the nav6 in order to change the type of Streaming Update message the nav6 will transmit to the client.

||
||Byte Offset||Element||Data Type||
||0||Stream Type (YPR or Raw)||8-bit ASCII Character||
||

||
||Stream Type||Description||
||'y'||Yaw, Pitch, Roll & Compass Heading Update||
||'r'||Raw Sensor Data Update||
||

== Stream Configuration Response ==

Whenever a Stream Configuration Command is received by the nav6, the nav6 responds by sending a Stream Configuration Response message, which is formatted as follows:

||
||Byte Offset||Element||Data Type||
||0||Stream Type (YPR or Raw)||8-bit ASCII Character||
||1||Gyroscope Full Scale Range (Degrees/sec)||16-bit Integer||
||5||Accelerometer Full Scale Range (G)||16-bit Integer||
||9||Update Rate (Hz)||16-bit Integer||
||13||Calibrated Yaw Offset||Float||
||20||Calibrated Quaternion W Offset (15-bits, signed)||16-bit Integer||
||24||Calibrated Quaternion X Offset (15-bits, signed)||16-bit Integer||
||28||Calibrated Quaternion Y Offset (15-bits, signed)||16-bit Integer||
||32||Calibrated Quaternion Z Offset (15-bits, signed)||16-bit Integer||
||36||Flags||16-bit Integer||
