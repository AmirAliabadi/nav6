The development of nav6 could not happen without the contributions and support of many people.  Kauai Labs would like to especially thank the following for the part they played in making nav6 a success:

  * James Massaro, whose vision and tireless efforts to create, organize and lead FRC Team 2465 - the Kauaibots - Kauai's island-wide FIRST Robotics Team.  James has continually supported and encouraged the development of the nav6, starting in late 2012 when it was just an idea.
  
  * Cynthia Libert, my wife, who patiently put up with the long nights and early mornings when work on the nav6 meant less time for yard work, helping around the house and walks on the beach.  Cynthia is now running the Kauai Labs shipping department and ensuring that those who order the nav6 receive it quickly and correctly.
  
  * Will Martin, FRC Team 11, an early nav6 customer who has helped develop and improve some of the Java Library code which simplifies the integration of the nav6 on a Java-based FRC robot.
  
  * Joe Ross, Mentor, FRC Team 330 (Beachbots), who volunteered to develop a LabView VI Library, which simplifies the integration of the nav6 on a !LabView-based FRC robot.
  
  * The various companies who sponsor the Kauaibots, including BAE Systems, Oceanit Labs, Lappert's Ice Cream, Kapaa Rotary Club, Young Brothers, the Kauai Economic Development Board, Lifeway Pharmacy, NASA, the Parker Group, STU LLC, Syngenta, Textron, J R Welding and Equipment Repairs, Commercial Plumbing Inc., Pioneer, Basil Scott, and many, many others.
