Alternatively, an enclosure can be fashioned from existing items, such as a plastic tool box.  The key features of a well-designed enclosure include:

  * The enclosure protects its contents from damage.
  * The enclosure can be securely mounted (e.g., to a robot chassis).
  * The enclosure can provide strain relief for any cables which enter/exit the enclosure.
  * The enclosure can be opened if necessary to service its contents.
