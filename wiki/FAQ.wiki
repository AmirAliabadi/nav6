*Will nav6 work with the new National Instruments RoboRio that will be used starting in the 2015 FRC Season?*

Yes.  Although the National Instruments RoboRio does not provide a RS-232 Serial Port,  the nav6 can be connected to the National Instruments RoboRio via one it its 2 USB host ports.  To accomplish this, a RS-232 to USB converter cable is needed.

A RS-232 to USB converter cable is inexpensive, and is also very useful - since with this cable the nav6 IMU can be re-programmed using the Arduino IDE.
