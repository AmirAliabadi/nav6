#summary How to connect the nav6 IMU to a CRio-based system (e.g., a FIRST FRC competition robot)

= Introduction =

Connecting the nav6 IMU to the CRio on a FIRST FRC robot is a very simple process and can be accomplished in just a few minutes.

The following are needed to accomplish this integration:

  * nav6 IMU Circuit Board
  * nav6 Power Wire harness(with 2-pin JST "PH" style connector)
  * DB9 Male-to-female straight-through serial cable

Note that the DB9 Male-to-female cable is a "straight-through" cable, NOT a "crossover" cable.

First, connect the nav6 Power wire harness to one of the unregulated 12-volt connections on the power distribution board.  The nav6 consumes approximately 200 milliamps of current and thus can be connected to any of the 12-Volt power distribution board connections.  The nav6 requires a  minimum voltage of 5.5 volts.

Next, connect the male DB9 connector to the nav6 circuit board, and the female DB9 connector to the CRio.

Finally, integrate the provide C++ IMU class into your robot software.  The IMU constructor must be provided a pointer to an instance of the WPI Library SerialPort class.

The IMU::IsConnected() method indicates whether data is successfully being received from the IMU.  At this point, the IMU::GetPitch(), IMU::GetRoll() and IMU::GetYaw() methods can be used to access the latest values received from the IMU.

The IMU::GetUpdateCount() can be used to determine if new yaw/pitch/roll values have arrived.
