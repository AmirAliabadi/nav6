#summary How to customize the IMU source code

= Introduction =

The nav6 IMU is fully open source, both hardware and software.  If you are a software developer and want to change the behavior of the IMU, you can modify the source code for the IMU by following these instructions.

NOTE: To interface the Arduino IDE to the nav6 from a computer without a RS-232 serial port, you can use an inexpensive USB-to-RS-232 converter cable such as found at http://www.iogear.com/product/GUC232A/. 

= Details =

1) Download the free Arduino IDE.

2) Install subversion and check out the IMU source code.

3) Modify the source code in the Arduino IDE.

4) Connect to the IMU via the Serial Port. 

5) Download the modified software into the IMU using the Arduino IDE.

*NOTE:  At any time you can re-load the latest official IMU firmware using this same process.  The latest official IMU firmware source code is located at http://code.google.com/p/nav6/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Farduino
